# Introduction

▪ What is ethics? Ethics asks what sort of people we are

▪ how we think

▪ what sort of thing we do

▪ what sort of thing we don’t do

▪ These three guidelines from Jesus will be important as we look at Old Testament ethics: ask how the implications of the Old Testament’s teaching need to be spelled out, ask how its teaching expresses love for God or love for neighbor, and ask how far it is laying down creation ideals and how far it is making allowance for our hard-heartedness

▪ The title “the Law” for these five books is a misleading translation of the word Torah, which means “instruction” or “teaching.” And it’s generally misleading to think of its individual sections of teaching as “laws,” as if they were like Western state law or canon law. A concrete indication of that fact within the Old Testament itself is that one can find little match between the prescriptions the Torah lays down and the way Israel actually handles offenses such as murder, idolatry, and adultery. It seems that it’s not the case that Israel knows it’s supposed (say) to execute murderers, idolaters, and adulterers, and fails to do so. Even faithful, Torah-keeping leaders don’t treat the Torah as a statute book. They know they are not supposed to be literalistic in interpreting these “laws

▪ This phenomenon would be more puzzling were it not for the fact it features among other Middle Eastern peoples. When a king lays down a set of statutes, it doesn’t mean they become the basis of legal practice. They are rather a collection of indications of the kind of moral and social norms that the king claims to be committed to. The Old Testament operates on a parallel basis. “Laws” that prescribe execution for murder, adultery, idolatry, and a long list of other acts are markers of the kind of religious, moral, and social commitments that God expects his people to accept. They are indications of how serious these offenses are. They comprise teaching on theological ethics in the form of laws. Understood this way, the Torah becomes more obviously useful for an understanding of Old Testament ethics

# 34 Ruth: Commitment

▪ the reason the story of Ruth was in the Scriptures was because it was all about hesed

▪ There are two ways in which the story of Ruth is about hesed. The actual word comes three times, which is a lot for a book of four chapters. And the people in the story keep giving us illustrations of hesed even when the word isn’t used

▪ Naomi cooks up a plan for Ruth to beguile Boaz into accepting a proposal of marriage

# Conclusion

▪ On one hand, he assumes that the Old Testament can contribute significantly to an understanding of salvation through faith in Christ Jesus

▪ His point is that the entirety of these Old Testament Scriptures is significant for the life that Timothy lives and for the lives lived by the people Timothy is ministering to. It has a role to play in equipping them for good works. The people for whom it is significant are “God’s people”—Jews no doubt, but in the context of this letter, Gentiles too
