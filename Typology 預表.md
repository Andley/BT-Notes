預表的定義：
> Typology is the study of the relationship between OT revealed truths of persons, events, institutions ("types") which God has specifically designed to correspond to, and predictively prefigure, their intensified "antitypical" fulfillment in Christ and his people. 
> --- Stephen J. Wellum, "Editorial: Thinking about Typology," *SBTJ*  21.1 (2017): 6.

Gentry and Wellum define typology as 
> the study of the Old Testament salvation-historical realities or “types” (persons, events, institutions) which prefigure their intensified antitypical fulfilment aspects (inaugurated and consummated) in New Testament salvation history.
> --- Gentry and Wellum, Kingdom through Covenant, 103

This definition usefully highlights the essential features of a biblical type. 

First, types are historical (“salvation historical realities”). 
Second, types are prospective (“prefigure”). 
Third, types exhibit escalation in moving from type to antitype (“intensified antitypical fulfillment”). 
Fourth, types are textual (“OT” and “NT salvation history”). 
Finally, as Wellum and Gentry imply throughout the book, types are unfolded through the covenants.

預表的特色：
1) 預表既要扎根於歷史 (history)，又要有文本 (text) 根據。
2) 預表 ≠ 預言 (prophecy)。預言是用話語來預告將來要發生的事；預表雖然也是事先預告 (prophetic and predictive)，但卻是要是歷史上真實出現過的人物、事件，或體制。
	- Wellum 認為 typology 算是 indirect prophecy (Wellum 2017, 7)，但我覺得還是分開比較好，預言是 Word，但 Type 是 person/event/institution。
	- Typology 可以解釋保羅所說的「奧秘」(Eph 1:9-10; 3:1-10; Rom 16:25-27)
3) 預表 (type) → 對範 (anti-type) 的發展有三個軸線：時間上 (先 → 後)、份量上 (小 → 大)、盟約上 (舊 → 新)。
	- **疑問：預表是不是 authorially-intended ?**
