Raymond E. Brown (1955) 定義：
> 「更圓滿意思」是指神預期會有的那個附加的、更深的意思，但它卻不是那位人類作者有清楚意圖要表達的。當人領會啟示的時候，他要依據進一步的啟示或啟示的進一步發展，才能看見那個意思存在於某節聖經經文（或某組經文，甚或是整卷書）的字詞中。

> The  sensus  plenior  is  that  additional,  deeper  meaning, intended by God, but not clearly intended by the human author, which is seen to exist in the words of a biblical text (or group of texts, or even a whole book) when they are studied in the light of further revelation or development in the understanding of revelation
