Brian Rosner 的定義：
> Biblical theology may be defined as theological interpretation of Scripture in and for the church. It proceeds with historical and literary sensitivity and seeks to analyze and synthesize the Bible's teaching about God and his relations to the world on its own terms, maintaining sight of the Bible's overarching narrative and Christocentric focus.

# 聖經神學解經方法 (Biblical-Theological Exegesis)

聖經神學  (BT) 不只是神學 (theology)，也是解經方法 (exegesis method)。所以 Greg Beale 定義 Biblical-Theological Exegesis (聖經神學解經方法)：
> A biblical-theological approach attempts to interpret texts in light of their broader literary context, their broader redemptive-historical epoch of which they are a part, and interpret earlier texts from earlier epochs, attempting to explain them in the light of progressive revelation to which earlier scriptural authors would not have had access.
> --- G. K. Beale, *The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism: Responding to New Challenges to Biblical Authority*  (Wheaton: Crossway, 2008), 104n41.

此外，這個方法必須是可以驗證的：
> A biblical-theological approach affirms that God’s intended meaning may far surpass what a human author intends, but this divine intent must be a demonstrable outgrowth of the human author’s intent and is exegetically verifiable within the bounds of the canon.
> --- Aubrey Sequeira and Samuel C Emadi, “Biblical-Theological Exegesis and the Nature of Typology,” *SBTJ* 21.1 (2017): 11–34.

聖經神學解經方法 = 正典進路 (Canonical Approach) [[Moo-2016]]
> The canonical approach decreases and may eliminate the questionable division between the human and divine authors’ intentions in a given text. This approach does not appeal to the divine author’s meaning that is deliberately concealed from the human author in the process of inspiration (a *sensus occultus*); it appeals to the meaning of the text itself that takes on deeper significance as God’s plan unfolds (a *sensus praegnans*). When God breathes out his words through human authors, he surely knows what the ultimate meaning of their words will be, but he has not created a double entendre or hidden a meaning in the words that we can uncover only through special revelation. The “added meaning” that the text takes on is the product of the ultimate canonical shape, although often we can clearly perceive it only if God reveals it.
